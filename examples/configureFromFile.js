/**
@example configureFromFile.js

This example shows how to configure a pipeline with 51Degrees location
provider from a configuration file using the pipelineBuilder's
buildFromConfigurationFile method.

This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/location-node/blob/master/examples/configureFromFile.js).

To run this example, you will need to create a **resource key**.
The resource key is used as short-hand to store the particular set of
properties you are interested in as well as any associated license keys
that entitle you to increased request limits and/or paid-for properties.

You can create a resource key using the 51Degrees
[Configurator](https://configure.51degrees.com).

Make sure to include the Country property, as it is required to run this
example.

The configuration file used here is:

@include 51d.json

Expected output:

```
Which country is the location [51.458048,-0.9822207999999999] in? United Kingdom

```
